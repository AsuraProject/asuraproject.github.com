# ASURA GLASS

<a href="https://github.com/AsuraProject/asuraproject.github.com/blob/master/README-ptbr.md">Portuguese README</a>

This project is already archived (2017) and has not been finalized, however, it is maintained on Github (and I am creating a README) due to nostalgia =)

Asura Glass was a project (which did not go forward) of mine, which aimed to build a smartglass. Despite not being able to complete the project, get a lot of knowledge, especially in web technologies.

## What would the smartglass look like?

- It would consist of a 64x32 screen and an accelerometer. The screen would show texts, pixels, drawings, etc. that would come from a mobile application. The accelerometer would be responsible for giving commands, such as "Up", "Down", "Left", "Right", which would be sent to a cell phone application through bluetooth.

- The application would connect via bluetooth, and there would be a Core (WebView) that would use .js files, which would be the "applications" installed for the glasses. These .js would be created in <a href="https://github.com/AsuraProject/AsuraIDE"> Asura IDE </a>, which would have functions to draw and write on the screen and events to identify whether the user gave some command for the application (Up, Down, Left, Right).

- In the application it would be possible to download .js applications, which would add more applications to the smartglass.

- In the <a href="https://github.com/AsuraProject/WebService"> WebService </a> it would be possible to upload these .js files created in the Asura IDE, which would be made available in the application for download.

## Because it did not work?

- I had no technical knowledge to build the final piece of hardware;

- I didn't have $ to finish the hardware part;

- I tried to start another project with the same focus, but my bluetooth module burned and I couldn't continue = /;

- It has no use, it is just for fun / study.
